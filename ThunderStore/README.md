# Death Note

## Description

Adds the Death Note as a rare scrap item to kill your friends with! Allows you to choose a type of death and death animation so you can cover up your deaths and get Shinigami Eyes to see the names of players and monsters.

## Features/How to use

(NEW UI)
- Open the book with left click while holding it
- Enter the username of the player you want to die.
- Click submit and you will have 40 seconds to choose a type of death and time (00:00AM/PM format) for your victum. Time is configurable in the configs.
- Click submit again to add their name to the right and when the time runs out they'll die.
- You can trade half of your life for the ability to see player and monster names above their head
- Typing a monsters name in the Name section correctly allows you to specify a timeofdeath and the book will attempt to kill that monster

## Upcoming Plans

- Animation when opening the book
- Ability to specify a type of death after the players name, depending on the type, it will spawn any enemy that kills using that type to kill your target. The monster will have increased speed, health and damage. If it doesnt kill them in a certain amount of time, they will die from a heart attack.
